# Hubitat
This is a repository dedicated to any custom Apps and Drivers I make for the Hubitat Platform.

All my code is free to use. Please note the license : If you change the code, publish your changes so the community can benefit.

I have Drivers for : 
- Ring Alarm Contact Sensor G2
- Ring Alarm Keypad V2
- MTA Bus Time API _(TBD on posting)_

You can contact me on the Hubitat Community site : [Hubitat Community Profile](https://community.hubitat.com/u/mikenyc/summary)

I do take requests/commissions for custom Apps/Drivers. Although the code here is free to use, I spent alot of time on these apps/drivers. Thus, if they assist you and you're feeling generous please consider donating or buying me a cup of coffee : [Venmo Profile](https://account.venmo.com/u/Mike--Dam)
